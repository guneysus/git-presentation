## About Version Control


What is version control, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 

Local Version Control Systems
---
Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.￿

---

## What is Git?

Git is an open source, distributed version control system designed for speed an efficiency.


---

# Git Basics

# Getting a Repo


---

## Create an empty repo

![][init1]
![][init2]

Or command line
`git init`

---

## or Clone

a existing repository on the anywhere that you have permission to read.
![][clone3]
`git clone https://github.com/careitu/git-presentation.git`

`git clone git@github.com:careitu/git-presentation.git`

These two addressed nearly the same and if you want to push your work to this
repo, you must use these addresses.

Third one is the read-only. 
`git clone git://github.com/careitu/git-presentation.git`

---

# Clone

![][clone1] 
![][clone2]


---
## or Fork

an existing repo on [Github][]
![][Fork]

--- 



## Add files to the working directory

`touch new_file.txt`

`git add new_file.txt`

---

## Or Add files with Github GUI

Or your Git GUI (Source tree, Github for Mac, Github for Windows, etc)
will recognize files that are not added to your working directory.


---

## Commit the changes
If you have done your local work, 
You can commit the changes with **descriptive** message.

It is recommended that you finished a small task of your project, then commit.

**Do not Commit** if you changed `flie` to `file`


---
# Commit and Add with Github GUI
With Github you can commit and add new files at the same dialog.

![][add1]

---


## Summary

* `Init/Clone/Fork` a repo to your computer
* `Edit/Add` some files to your working directory.
* Review your changes.
* `Commit` the changes to your local copy.
* If you have write permission to remote repo,
`push` the changes
* Visual Cheat Sheet:

## Conflict

Conflict occurs if

* A file changed by two or more people/branch
 And try to push the changes central repository
 And the 'Source Control Software' can not decide which one should be selected.
