<p>What is version control, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. </p>

<ul>
<li>Local Version Control Systems
Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.￿</li>
</ul>

<li>Centralized Version Control Systems</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Distributed Version Control Systems
This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Nearly Every Operation Is Local</p></li>
<li><p>Snapshots, Not Differences</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Committed</em> means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</p>

<p><em>Modified</em> means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.</p>

<p><em>Staged</em> means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</p>

<p>The basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>You modify files in your working directory.</li>
<li>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</li>
<li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory
<code>$ git init</code>
This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. </p></li>
<li><p>Cloning an Existing Repository</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You clone a repository with git clone <code>[url]</code>. For example, if you want to clone the Ruby Git library called Grit, you can do so like this:</p>

<p><code>$ git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git</code></p>
